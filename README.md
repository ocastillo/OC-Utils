OC-Utils
========

These are just a couple of basic Javascript utilities that I wrote and use to allow me to untie myself from all the frameworks and libraries out there.  Nothing against frameworks and libraries - there are lots of cool stuff out there and I still use them when needed.  But sometimes I just need these.

These utilities came about because I wanted to simplify and also see how other frameworks worked.  So some of this resembles other frameworks because, in some cases, the ideas came from them.

  * oc-router.js: Simple router for your single page app.  This uses pushState and not hashtags.  Older browsers will simply reload the page.
  * oc-ajax.js: The name says it all.

## Demo

The demo is a simple node app so you can get an idea of how I use this utils.
